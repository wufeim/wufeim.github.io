I am a PhD student at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu), advised by [Bloomberg Distinguished Professor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Distinguished_Professorships) [Dr. Alan Yuille](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/). I also work as an applied scientist intern at Amazon FAR (Frontier AI & Robotics).

I obtained my B.S. with <i>summa cum laude</i> honor from [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://rpi.edu) in 2020 and I had a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. During my undergraduate years, I had worked with [Prof. BÃ¼lent Yener](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~yener/) on discriminative and generative models for microstructure images and with [Prof. Lirong Xia](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~xial/) on preference learning from natural language.

I am seeking research-oriented opportunities in industry and would welcome the chance to connect if you think there's a potential fit.
